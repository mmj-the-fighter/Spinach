# Spinach
A framework for starting with computer graphics. It uses SDL3 library.  
But can be retargetted to other windowing frameworks by modifying the source code.  
  
Useful for:  
- Writing lab programs in a first course for computer graphics  
  (pixels, lines, polygons, circles,  ellipses, filling, clipping, transforms etc.)  
- Writing raytracers  
- Writing programs for advanced curves  
- Writing software rasterizers   
- Writing image processing routines
- Games
- and so on.
